- 👋 Hi, I’m @penneybah
- 👀 I’m interested in how to build things myself
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to upgrade my 20 year old Java and LAMP-stack coding skills to modern frameworks
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a tool that outperforms the S&P
- 📫 How to reach me @stevepenney_net on Twitter is probably a good start
